"How do I negotiate a salary offer?","Research market rates for the role, know your minimum acceptable salary, let the employer state a number first, highlight your value, and practice your talking points. Negotiate the entire package, not just base pay."
"What are the signs of a phishing email?","Look for generic greetings, urgent or threatening language, spoofed sender addresses, requests for personal information, and suspicious links or attachments. When in doubt, contact the company directly."
"What is 'networking' and how do I do it effectively?","Networking is building professional relationships. It's about offering help to others, not just asking for favors. Be genuine, listen more than you talk, and connect with people through events, LinkedIn, and informational interviews."
"How often should I back up my computer?","The 3-2-1 rule is best: have at least 3 total copies of your data, 2 of which are local but on different devices (e.g., computer and external drive), and 1 copy off-site (e.g., cloud storage). Automate this if possible."
